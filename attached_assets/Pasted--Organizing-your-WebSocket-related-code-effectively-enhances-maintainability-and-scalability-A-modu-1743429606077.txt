​Organizing your WebSocket-related code effectively enhances maintainability and scalability. A modular structure allows for clear separation of concerns, making your application easier to navigate and extend. Here's a recommended directory structure tailored to your project:​

Key Components:

websockets/index.ts: This file initializes the WebSocket server, manages client connections, and sets up event listeners. By centralizing the WebSocket setup here, you maintain a clear entry point for real-time functionalities.​

websockets/handlers/: Each file in this directory corresponds to specific WebSocket events or message types. For instance:​

notificationHandler.ts manages events related to real-time notifications.​

usageUpdateHandler.ts handles events concerning subscription usage updates.​

Additional handlers can be added as needed, each encapsulating the logic for a particular event type.​

websockets/utils.ts: Contains helper functions pertinent to WebSocket operations, such as message formatting, broadcasting utilities, or connection validation functions.​

Implementation Steps:

Initialize the WebSocket Server: In websockets/index.ts, set up the WebSocket server and define the connection logic.

Delegate Event Handling: Within the connection logic, delegate specific events to their respective handlers located in the handlers/ directory. This promotes modularity and makes the codebase easier to manage.

Utilize Utility Functions: Leverage functions from websockets/utils.ts to perform common tasks, ensuring DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles are upheld.

Benefits of This Structure:

Modularity: Separating WebSocket logic into dedicated directories and files allows developers to locate and manage specific functionalities without sifting through unrelated code.​

Scalability: As your application grows, adding new WebSocket features becomes straightforward. New event handlers can be introduced without disrupting existing code.​

Maintainability: A clear structure reduces the cognitive load when onboarding new developers or revisiting the code after some time. Each component has a well-defined place, making the application more intuitive.​

By adopting this organized approach, you ensure that your WebSocket implementation remains clean, efficient, and adaptable to future requirements.
